Welcome to Editor Madness!

For this project, I have made a game played entirely through a custom editor window without going into playmode!

Many of the "levels" in this game have functionality that could be considered a tool to control aspects of different objects in the scene, including changing positions, colours, and even mock collision detection!

This project makes use of custom editor windows, custom editors, scriptable objects, and property drawers!

To get started, first open up the "Main" scene, and then open the "Editor Madness" window by, at the top, clicking Custom Editor->Editor Madness! The editor window assumes the main scene is loaded first!

You can move the window around as much as you want, but the intended way of "playing" is to make sure the custom window, the game view, and the inspector are all in view at all times! In my testing, I have started with the default view, then docked the custom window on top of the hierarchy, then made it wider! I also set the game view to 16:9 Aspect!

From here, you should be able to navigate through all 10 levels, solving the "puzzles" that are presented, which all aim to experiment with different custom editor functionally! Good luck!

For ease of marking, you can also use the previous and next buttons to skip through the levels! Closing and reopening the custom window will also reset everything!
